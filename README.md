# TDS-Project

1. Used Python’s requests library with GitHub’s API to retrieve data on users based on location and follower count. Also implemented pagination to handle multiple pages and extracted detailed profile and repository data for each user, saving results in CSV files.
2. Analysis revealed that tech hub locations (like Barcelona) tend to have higher follower counts, indicating that location can influence online influence and engagement.
3. For better visibility and network growth, developers should engage with followers in tech-focused cities. Building an active GitHub presence in these locations can increase recognition and opportunities.
